# DiscordEchoBot

This is a bot I'm developing for my personal use in some discord servers I share with friends.

Anyone is welcome to use the code if it helps them.

My current goals for this bot include
  * useful !commands and a !help describing the function and use of various commands
  * Voice echoing for use with practicing lines and VoiceStateUpdate
  * Save/Record commands to store voice clips for later use
